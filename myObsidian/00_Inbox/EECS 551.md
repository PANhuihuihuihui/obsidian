## Ch1
matrix: data or transformation
- example: human brain
transformation: $a$
Linear time-invariant system: impluse responsed function ?  
one sound echo 5 seconds  M =T+ k-1 (who difine K ? )
Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
${y} = H x$


In general, for any matrix, the eigenvectors are NOT always orthogonal. But for a special type of matrix, symmetric matrix, the eigenvalues are always real and the corresponding eigenvectors are always orthogonal.

## What is XML?
-   XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
-   XML is a markup language much like HTML

-   XML was designed to be self-descriptive
-   XML is a W3C Recommendation

```xml
<note>  
  <to>Tove</to>  
  <from>Jani</from>  
  <heading>Reminder</heading>  
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>  
</note>
```

Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive, store, or display it:

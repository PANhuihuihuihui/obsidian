### footnotes
----
Footnotes aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but theyÂ [supported by GFM](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#footnotes).
here is a simple footnote[^1]

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  











[^1]: My reference.

[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces. This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.

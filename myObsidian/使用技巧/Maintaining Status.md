**How do I maintain my "status"?**

    -   12 credits for Undergrad Students
    -   8 credits for Graduate Students
        -   6 credits for Grad Students with GSI/GSRA
    -   For the Fall 2022  Semester, new students cannot take all their courses online.  New students must take at least one in-person or hybrid class.  We highly recommend that new students enroll in at least three credits of in-person or hybrid classes to protect their immigration status.
-   No unauthorized employment!

    -   SEVIS = current or most recent address **in the US**.
    -   CURRENT = where you are living now. If you are in the U.S. now, your current and SEVIS addresses will be the same.
    -   PERMANENT = home country address (cannot be U.S.)

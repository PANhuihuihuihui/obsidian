## What is ORM
**Object–relational mapping** (**ORM**, **O/RM**, and **O/R mapping tool**) in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") is a [programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming") technique for converting data between [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system "Type system") using [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented "Object-oriented") programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual [object database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_database "Object database")" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object–relational mapping, although some programmers opt to construct their own ORM tool

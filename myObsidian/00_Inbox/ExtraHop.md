Hello, my name is Jackson. Iâ€™m a first-year master student under ECE programming studying signal proceesing and mechine learning.  I finished my undergrad in HKU major in CS 

For the past two years,  I have publiched one paper about approximating the softmax function in Machine Learning  areas and accumulated lots of programming skill not only in academic but also insdustrial field.  what's more, I had an project about implementing a online streaming 
 websorket and I am taking distrubuted system course this sem, which will have lots of project implement in Go

I think my experience in Programming and distrubuted system  would make me a good fit for an internship with your company. Would you be able to tell me more about your internship program?


what's your favouriate project?

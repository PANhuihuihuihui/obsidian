**Internship Program at Tesla**   
The Internship Recruiting Team is driven by the passion to recognize and develop emerging talent. Our year-round program places the best students in positions where they will grow technically, professionally, and personally through their experience working closely with their Manager, Mentor, and team. We are dedicated to providing an experience that allows the intern to experience life at Tesla by including them in projects that are critical to their team’s success. Instead of going on coffee runs and making copies, our interns have a seat at the table and make critical decisions that will influence not only their team, but the overall achievement of Tesla’s mission.

Applications Engineering: We are currently looking for an intern to help architect, build, manage and operate the Infrastructure & applications for Tesla’s Engineering teams including Connected Systems, Firmware and Autopilot. In this role, you will plan, design, implement as well as manage ongoing Infrastructure components that powers the development of Tesla’s Vehicles and technologies.

• Business Ops & Infrastructure: The Infrastructure Engineering team designs and implements a diverse set of services and tools that power our internal software and processes. The projects you support will have a significant impact on the business and will allow us to grow at exceptional speeds. A strong candidate will either be an excellent software generalist, or experience in fullstack.

• Infotainment Software: The Infotainment team is responsible for creating the best-in-class car experiences on the market. From watching Youtube while you charge, to playing Beach Buggy 2 with a friend, engineers on this team ensure that our vehicles are both intuitive as well as fun!

• Service Software Engineering: The Service Engineering team develops tools, processes, and informational content that multiplies the efforts of the field support team. They bridge the gap between what happens with our products in the field and how they’re designed in engineering. Interns on this team will work on areas ranging from software tools for diagnostics to product support.

• Vehicle Software: The Vehicle Software team lies at the forefront of innovation, constantly pushing the boundaries of performance and in-car experiences. From Tesla maps and UI, to over-the-air updates, interns will work side by side expert engineers to create services and features that set our vehicles apart from the competition.

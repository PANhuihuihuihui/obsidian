Hello, my name is Jackson. I’m a first-year master student under ECE programming studying signal proceesing and mechine learning.  I finished my undergrad in HKU major in CS and minor in Statistic 

For the past two years,  I have publiched one paper about approximating the softmax function in Machine Learning  areas and accumulated lots of programming skill not only in  academic but also insdustrial field.  what's more in my undergrad peroid, I have participated the training algothrim competion host by Jean-street, Although, I did not get a good ranking, the experince is so intereseting.

I think my experience in Machine Learning, Programming and statistic  would make me a good fit for an internship with your company. Would you be able to tell me more about your internship program?


what's the project is about?
